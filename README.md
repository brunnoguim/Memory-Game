# Future Changes (maybe?)
- ⬜️ Add RNG for the cards' positions (although my gf really liked this project, there's not much replayability to it)
- ✅ Add a win screen on the game's completion (with a replay option)
- ✅ Add a score based on your play time
- ⬜️ Replace the window.alerts currently used to output the result of each pair of choices (deu boa/deu ruim)
- ⬜️ Improve the loading time on the very well designed (and necessary) sound effects
- ⬜️ Make it responsive
- ⬜️ Disable clicks on cards already clicked
