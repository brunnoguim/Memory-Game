# Memory-Game
Simple memory game that I made to practice js (while also entertaining my gf with it's cards and sound effects)

# Future Changes (maybe?)
- Add random generated positions for the cards (although my gf really liked the experience, currently there's not much replayability to this)
- Add a win screen on the game's completion (with a replay option)
- Add a score based on your play time
- Substitute the window.alerts currently used to output the result of each pair of choices (deu boa/deu ruim)
- Improve the loading time on the very well designed (and necessary) sound effects
- Make it responsive
