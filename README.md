# Future Changes (maybe?)
- [ ] Add RNG for the cards' positions (although my gf really liked this project, there's not much replayability to it)
- [X] Add a win screen on the game's completion (with a replay option)
- [ ] Add a score based on your play time
- [ ] Substitute the window.alerts currently used to output the result of each pair of choices (deu boa/deu ruim)
- [ ] Improve the loading time on the very well designed (and necessary) sound effects
- [ ] Make it responsive
- [ ] Disable clicks on cards already clicked
